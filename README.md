# Stock analysis
## Purpose
* Project to analyze entire stock market data from 2017 – 2018 and requires to refactor original script in VBA to improve execution time.
## Results
The original script’s run time was tested on a set data and resulted in timing of 0.49 seconds for 2017 and 0.48 seconds for 2018.  After the script was refactored, it resulted in improved run time of 0.07 secs for both 2017 and 2018 data.  
Below are screenshots of run times for both before and after refactoring of script:

## Summary: 
With the refactored script, it takes less time to analyze the data.  This improved run time will help with an expected increase of data volume and allows expansion of data analysis of larger data sets.  The disadvantage of refactoring script is that it requires extensive retesting of functionality to ensure that it continues to provide same outcome.
